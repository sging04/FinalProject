## Description
A flask website that allows you to upload your old school files for other people to practice with! Don't worry about typing it in manually as our technologies will be able to handle it for you!

## Roles
- Sean Ging (PM): Frontend (Main Page, Profile)
- Patrick Ging (Backend Go/Python)
- David Chong (Frontend)
    
- Aryman Goenka (Backend)

## API Cards

## Launch Codes
Enter the following commands
FIRST:
install Tesseract

Tesseract installation instructions 
https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html
DIFFERENT FOR UBUNTU, MAC, WINDOWS, which CAN'T be simplified into a list on a read me, since it is so long.

Then find the location of tesseract's bin (or the exe if you happen to be on windows). If you're a windows user, you can start at the program files, but if you're on something else, start with ```which tesseract``` and following it until you approach the location of the program.

Once you have that location, go to location.txt in the app folder and replace the second line with the location you just copied.

Once done.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:sging04/FinalProject.git
$ cd FinalProject
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 -m venv <name>
$ source <name>/bin/activate
$ cd app
$ python3 __init__.py
```
