Hey! 

You're probably wondering what this folder is.

This folder is important for the testing code.

"Patrick why is this necessary?"

Well in the renderImage function in the api file, the function calls a removeImage() call which deletes the image. 

Since we don't want to delete the test examples, I have code written in the test that makes a copy and python can delete those instead.

This folder simply exists for that programatic convience.

Alrighty! Don't delete this!

See you in a bit!
